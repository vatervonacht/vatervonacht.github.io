title: Meltdown Redux
excerpt: "Tom Woods delivered a *Meltdown* smackdown to Keynesians in 2009.  Another (bigger) meltdown is looming. Time to blow the dust of this gem."

I was in Portland, Oregon recently and went to the most fantastic of book
stores - [Powell's City of Books](http://www.powells.com).  If I hadn't had
another purpose for being in Portland, I think I would have spent the entire
week there.

over one million new and used books, there is something for everyone - even an
Austrian Economics geek like me.  While they didn't dedicate a whole floor to
the Austrian School (I know, what were they thinking?!) I did walk away with an
awesome 60-page minibook by Rothbard, *The Essential von Mises*.

Back in Ohio, inspired by Powells, I started looking for used bookstores in the
hope that I would find more little treasures. I was fortunate enough to walk
into a tiny place crammed with 50,000+ used books - and having an inventory
reduction sale.  I picked up Tom Woods' *Meltdown* for a mere $3.00. What a
bargain!  

Now, I already have a signed copy of the book at home.  However, if you're
sharing this stuff with friends like I am (and you should be sharing this with
friends) having another copy to pass around helps to "scale" Tom's influence.

Having the book is cool, but reading it is even cooler(?).  It's good to be
prepared for the coming bust that is certain to make the 2008 crisis look like
child's play in comparison.  For sure we'll hear the same tired and inane rants
against some cartoon-like concept of "the market" or "capitalism".  These need
to be smacked down quickly and thoroughly with a laser-sharp exposition of the
real causes. Against the inevitable calls for more state intervention, the
Austrian should be ready to make the case for alternative prescriptions.

After re-reading *Meltdown*, these are my key takeaways.

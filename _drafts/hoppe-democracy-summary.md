# Democracy in Six Words

I did, regrettably again, what I often do on Facebook and responded to a post on
a non-trivial topic by simply pasting a link to a great book - a
book that any intellectually-honest person, having read it, must agree settles
the matter and smashes any opposing view.   

The post in question was rightly criticizing the voters of New Jersey for 
having re-electing a corrupt politician to a position of power.  I deftly slipped in
a link to Hans-Hermann Hoppe's *Democracy, The God That Failed*.  Argument over,
right?

Why do I do that? Not everyone has the time to read a book for every topic that
pops up in their feed.  But most anything worth understanding requires more than
a FB post fat-fingered from an iPhone, half-distracted, during one of those 
magical "mobile moments" (you know, like one of those many unproductive meetings).  

Besides, how *would* I actually summarize my position if someone were to ask me about it?  

"Here, read this. See ya' later." 

That's not likely to win over even the most curious of minds. 

It got me thinking about an anecdote - likely more legend than fact - attributing the
following six-word story to Earnest Hemmingway.

> For sale: baby shoes, never worn.

Ouch. That's a lot packed in six words.  

Whether the anecdote is fact or fiction matters not. I wondered whether or not
I could come up with a simple sequence of six-word statements that would 
summarize Hoppe's *Democracy*.  So here goes...


* Space, Time, and things are scarce.
* Claims to scarce goods are rivalrous.
* Conflict can arise from rivalrous claims.
* Private property rules mitigate rivalrous conflict.
* States violate property by their nature.
* Economic growth requires capital accumulation.
* Capital accumulation requires lower time preferences
*
